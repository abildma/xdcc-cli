> Built with Go 1.19+, Bubble Tea, Lipgloss and fluffle/goirc.

This project provides a user-friendly terminal interface to search and download files from IRC networks through the XDCC protocol. It is based on the popular [goirc](https://github.com/fluffle/goirc) library and features a modern TUI (Terminal User Interface) for improved usability.

## Features
- Interactive TUI with keyboard navigation
- File search from multiple search engines
- Multiple file selection and batch downloads
- Real-time search results and download progress
- Visual file selection with checkboxes
- Command-line mode for scripting compatibility

## Installation

### Prerequisites
* Go 1.19+ in your `$PATH`
* `git` and an IRC-friendly network connection

### Quick run (no compile step)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abildma/xdcc-cli.git
cd xdcc-cli
go run ./cmd            # launches the TUI immediately
```

### Build binary

```bash
make                 # outputs ./bin/xdcc
# or manually
GO111MODULE=on go build -o xdcc ./cmd
```

Assuming you have the latest version of Go installed on your system, you can use the **make** command to build an executable:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/abildma/xdcc-cli.git
cd xdcc-tui
make # this will output a bin/xdcc executable
```

## Usage

### TUI mode (default)

Run inside the repo or with the built binary:

```bash
./xdcc           # or go run ./cmd
```

Keyboard cheatsheet:

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `Type` + `Enter` | search bar | execute search |
| `‚Üë / ‚Üì` | results list | move cursor |
| `Space` | results list | select/unselect file |
| `Tab` | any | toggle between Search & Downloads tabs |
| `h / ‚Üê` | results | previous page |
| `l / ‚Üí` | results | next page |
| `d` | results | start download of selected files |
| `q` | any | quit |

Downloads tab shows `%` and `MB/s` in real time; completed transfers are ‚úÖ.

### TUI Mode (Recommended)

To start the interactive TUI mode, simply run:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ xdcc tui
```

This will launch the interactive terminal interface where you can:

1. **Search for files:**
   - Type your search keywords in the search field
   - Press Enter to perform the search
   - Results will appear in a scrollable list

2. **Select files for download:**
   - Use Up/Down arrows to navigate the results
   - Press Enter to select/deselect a file (a checkmark will appear)
   - Select multiple files for batch downloading

3. **Download files:**
   - After selecting files, press 'd' to start downloading
   - Progress will be displayed in real-time

4. **Keyboard shortcuts:**
   - Tab: Toggle between search and results view
   - Enter: Search (in search mode) or select file (in results mode)
   - d: Start download for selected files
   - q: Quit the application

### CLI mode (script-friendly)

Search:
```bash
./xdcc search "ubuntu 24.04"
```

Download directly:
```bash
./xdcc get "xdcc://irc.rizon.net/#botpack?file=1234" -o ~/Downloads
```

Supports multiple URLs or `-i urls.txt`.

The original command-line interface is still available for scripting or non-interactive use:

#### Search for files

```bash
foo@bar:~$ xdcc search keyword1 keyword2 ...
```

For example, to search for the latest ISO of Ubuntu:

```bash
foo@bar:~$ xdcc search ubuntu iso
```

This displays a table with file name, size, and URL.

#### Download files

```bash
foo@bar:~$ xdcc get url1 url2 ... [-o /path/to/an/output/directory]
```

You can also specify a .txt input file containing a list of URLs (one per line) using the **-i** switch.

## Development

```
go vet ./...
go test ./...   # (tests coming soon)
```

Run `go mod tidy` to clean unused deps.
